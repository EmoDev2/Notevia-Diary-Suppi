## 🔐 What is Notevia Diary SexrPro?

Notevia Diary SexrPro is a digital diary for users who value privacy and control. It allows multiple users to maintain their own encrypted journals, switch between entries using tabs, and write freely without distractions or external connections.

This app is ideal for:

- Personal journaling  
- Private note-taking  
- Secure writing in offline environments  
- Organizing thoughts across multiple tabs

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-User Profiles

Each user has:

- A unique login  
- Isolated encrypted storage  
- Line counter
- 

Users cannot access each other's data. Switching between profiles is fast and secure.

---

## 📑 Tabbed Interface

Inspired by Notepad++ and VS Code, Notevia Diary SexrPro allows users to open multiple entries simultaneously in separate tabs. You can:

- Create new tabs instantly  
- Rename or close tabs  
- Switch between entries with a single click  
- Save each tab independently
- Auto save
- Antilag core
- anti crash engine

This makes it easy to organize your thoughts, separate topics, or work on multiple drafts at once.

## 🔒 Local Encryption

All journal entries are encrypted and stored locally. The encryption is custom-built in Java and does not rely on external libraries. This ensures:

- No third-party access  
- No cloud exposure  
- Full control over your data

Even if someone accesses your device, they cannot read your entries without your credentials.
